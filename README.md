# Machine Learning Specialization - Course 2

In the second course of the Machine Learning Specialization, I will build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, apply best practices for machine learning development to ensure my models generalize to real-world data and tasks, and build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.
